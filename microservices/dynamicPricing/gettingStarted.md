# Building a Reactive Dynamic Pricing Microservice

This guide outlines the steps to create a reactive dynamic pricing microservice using MongoDB Atlas for data storage and management, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for computing and hosting services.

## Prerequisites
+ MongoDB Atlas account
+ Google Cloud Platform account
+ Basic understanding of Node.js and Express

## Step 1: Setting Up MongoDB Atlas

__Create a Cluster__: Sign in to your MongoDB Atlas account and create a new cluster. Choose a region that is closest to your user base for optimal performance.

__Configure Security__: Set up your cluster's security settings. Create database users with specific roles and enable IP whitelisting to secure your database connection.

__Connect to Your Cluster__: Use the connection string provided by Atlas to connect your application to your MongoDB database. You'll need this in the microservice configuration.

## Step 2: Developing the Microservice

+ __Clone the Repository__: Start by cloning the repository with the microservice code.

```git clone https://github.com/mongodb-industry-solutions/retail-store.git```

```cd retail-store/microservices/dynamicPricing ```

+ __Configure Environment Variables:__ Set up the necessary environment variables, including your MongoDB Atlas connection string and any other service-specific configurations.

+ __Develop the Pricing Logic:__ Modify the dynamicPricing service to implement your pricing algorithm. This could involve analyzing historical data, considering competitor pricing, and integrating real-time supply-demand signals.

## Step 3: Setting Up GCP

+ __Create a GCP Project:__ Log into your Google Cloud Console and create a new project for your microservice.

+ __Enable APIs:__ Ensure that the necessary APIs (e.g., Compute Engine, Kubernetes Engine) are enabled for your project.

+ __Configure GCP CLI:__ Install and initialize the Google Cloud CLI. Authenticate with your GCP account and set your project as the default.

```gcloud auth login```

```gcloud config set project [YOUR_PROJECT_ID]```
